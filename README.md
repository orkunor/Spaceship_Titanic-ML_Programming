#Machine learning program that predicts which passengers will be transported to an alternate dimension

In this project that I shared, I tried to predict the passengers who went to different dimensions using the data sets on kaggle.

I have installed the machine learning algorithm required to make predictions.

I am sharing the dataset named submission.csv which contains all my datasets and estimates.

Thank you to the Kaggle family
